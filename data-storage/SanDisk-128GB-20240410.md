## Unable to Read Issue (March 2025)
I am using SanDisk SD Card in my 70mai Dashcam for car.  Recently when I took out the SD Card Reader and connected to Windows 10 laptop, it worked well for sometime.  Suddenly Windows Explorer started giving error messages while reading the SD Card.  

I ejected SD Card and inserted it again on my Windows Laptop using the SD Card Reader.  The SD Card is getting detected and shows as a Drive Letter.  But when I try to open this Drive, I am getting this error:

<img src="./images/SanDisk-Dashcam-Win10-Err-20250323.png"/>

```
Location is not available

F:\ is not accessible.

The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.
```

In Windows Explorer, it detects the SD Card as F Drive, but does not show details in other columns (Total Space, Free Space, File System):

### Troubleshooting Step 1 - CHKDSK
I ran CHKDSK from Command Prompt (Administrator mode):

```
chkdsk F: /f /r /x
```

Sample output of `chkdsk` command is given  below. For the full output of chkdsk command, check this  [chkdsk-run-01.txt](./log/chkdsk-run-01.txt) file.

```
C:\Windows\system32>chkdsk f: /f /r /x
