# Redmi Note 12 5G - WiFi Calling (VoWiFi) Issue with Airtel SIM

## My Setup Details 
```
SIM 1 - Airtel 
SIM 2 - Jio 

Location: Bangalore - Home (Apartment 1st Floor)

Wired Broadband Connections 
1) ACT Fibernet
2) Hathway
```

## Background
I am staying at same place in Bangalore since 2 decades and have been using Mobile Phones since long.  My first mobile phone was `Nokia 5110`.  Until 3G, I was happy with Mobile Network quality inside my home.

New technology should solve existing problems and provide new features. But from the 4G era, Mobile Providers focused on hypnotizing Customers with Hi-Speed Data.  I got Jio connection and it worked well during the initial days. 

Come 4G and 5G, the Mobile Network started giving problem inside my Home. I have to goto Balcony to get better signal and have smooth conversation with the other party on mobile phone.

Now both Airtel and Jio gives me poor network inside 4 walls.  I have very poor Mobile Network (both Airtel and Jio) inside my home.  The WiFi Calling (VoWiFi) feature is a `life saver` for me.  It helps me to talk on mobile phone without any call drops inside the 4 walls.

As the population is increasing, the Mobile Operators are failing to provide good network signal at all locations in your city.  A moblie provider that works good at home, may not work good at your office place, or the vice-versa.  We are ending up with keeping Dual SIM cards!

I don't want to run behind 5G/Hi-Speed network which gives Hi-Speed only at certain locations. I prefer a stable Mobile Connection with good voice calls and with 5-10 Mbps Mobile Data speed. 

I cannot use Mobile Hotspot for Office Work at home. I depend on Wired Broadband for my work. 

## Issue Details
Now, with the above background, let me come to the detail of my issue.
1. Since the time I got RN12-5G Phone, the VoWiFi Feature of Airtel is not working.
1. I am using Airtel in SIM1 and Jio in SIM2.
1. The Jio SIM2 is showing VoWiFi all the time.
1. The Airtel SIM1 does not shows VoWiFi **most of the time**.  Rarely (random time) the Airtel SIM1 shows VoWiFi for few seconds and it again disappears.
1. I have two Wired Broadband Connections (ACT Fibernet and Hathway) at Home and I have verified the same result on both. 
1. VoWiFi is a savior 

## My Troubleshooting (on RN12-5G)
1. I tried to swap SIM1 and SIM2. But got the same VoWiFi issue with  Airtel.
1. I got the Airtel SIM changed.  But got the same VoWiFi issue with Airtel 

## My Observation
1. Before RN12-5G, I had Redmi Note 7 Pro (RN7Pro) phone. On my RN7Pro, VoWiFi was working perfectly alright on both Airtel and Jio SIM.
1. My Wife is using `Samsung Galaxy M21 2021 Edition` and VoWiFi is working fine on her Airtel SIM.
1. My Son is using `Vivo Y33s` and VoWiFi is working fine on his Airtel SIM.
